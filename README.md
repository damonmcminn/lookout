Learning Ruby by koans. Bored of manually executing path_to_enlightenment.rb.

Watch a directory for changes and execute a script.

Pop a symbolic link in your path:

ln -s /path/to/logger.js /usr/local/bin/logger


Usage:

logger -w /path/to/file/or/directory -s /path/to/enlightenment.rb -i {repl}

## I use pry
